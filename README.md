# Cancip

Obsidian right-side AI chat panel shaped toward a mobile-first agent workflow.

Cancip is a lightweight prototype for managing an Obsidian vault from a mobile-friendly AI panel:

- Multiple API profiles, each with its own Base URL, key, API mode, and model.
- Multilingual UI with auto device-language detection for Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, English, Uyghur, Turkish, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, French, German, and Arabic; missing low-frequency strings fall back to English, and Arabic/Uyghur use RTL layout hints.
- Automatic OpenAI Responses and OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions support.
- `.cancip/config.json` as the authoritative vault-level config.
- Two execution access modes only: confirmation mode reads freely and queues write-like actions for approval; full-access mode executes implemented actions directly. Access is controlled only by the UI or `.cancip/config.json`, not by conversation text.
- Current note, selection, dynamic `@` mentions, visible long-term/core memory folder, and on-demand Vault Search.
- `cancip-action` JSON tool blocks for validated vault-relative actions, including read/write/append/patch/mkdir/rename/copy.
- Agent-style tool runs: approval mode queues action blocks under the assistant message with Run/Reject controls, while Full access executes and records results.
- Tool result continuation loop: after tools finish, Cancip can feed results back into the model and continue for a bounded number of iterations, closer to local agent runs.
- Structured command bus actions for Obsidian internal commands, Cancip built-ins, and GitHub CLI-equivalent REST API commands.
- Obsidian-native Markdown rendering for chat messages, including Obsidian-supported HTML.
- Long-term/core memory defaults to visible `AI/Cancip/Memory/` and is included in every model interaction.
- Full-vault search is not attached by default. Cancip should first use long-term memory and necessary short-term/session context, then decide whether to run `cancip.searchVault` and read only the necessary matched files.
- Model calls use a payload policy: trivial chat stays lightweight, informational turns add only targeted context, and implementation/self-repair turns include the full tool protocol and compact memory.
- Full session export from the chat header to Markdown and JSON under visible `AI/Cancip/Exports/`.
- Lightweight project session history stays under `.cancip/sessions/`, opened from the compact history button beside the new-chat button.
- Compact context chips live inside the rounded composer/input box: the current active file is shown automatically with its extension, and source/context chips no longer occupy a separate panel.
- Context chips can be opened directly: file chips open the file in a tab, folder chips reveal the folder in the file navigator, and the small `x` removes only that context chip.
- On-demand Vault Search hits are metadata-only source suggestions until the agent explicitly reads selected files. They are not added to the composer chip row or model `contextText` by default. Exports keep the real full session snapshot, so the exported `contextText` is the authoritative record of what was sent as context.
- Rounded composer with floating upward icon trays for context, access mode, and model selection; trays overlay from their buttons and close after selection or outside taps.
- Header controls include a single Plan button. The Plan button opens the planning/todo panel; it is not a chat mode and does not change read/write permission.
- The header includes an OB Review Gate button wired to a programmatic TypeScript builder adapted from `arias007/ob-review-gate-skill`: it scans selected vault files, writes review data under `AI/Cancip/Review/`, and opens it inside a native Cancip audit panel with file lists, structure changes, diffs, old text, and new text.
- Structured Plan todos are available as `cancip-action` tools, so the agent can set/add/update/remove/list/clear the visible Plan panel during an agent run instead of only describing a plan in prose.
- The composer keeps the access selector visible and wider for mobile tapping, with a paperclip attachment button beside it for quickly adding file/folder context.
- Settings keep core items up front and move optional controls into advanced folded groups for interface, context, plan, command bus, local versioning, export, payment QR codes, and advanced model behavior.
- The settings page can show two local payment QR codes at the bottom from `extras/code-1.jpg` and `extras/code-2.png`; the QR images are local plugin resources and are not included in prompts or JSON exports.
- Built-in model presets include GPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen, and Kimi-style names while still allowing a custom model string.
- `@` picker for files, folders, Skills, Cancip functions, command bus entries, and real Obsidian commands. Empty `@` shows useful entries like modes/current file/recent files/skills; typed text dynamically filters all categories. Selected mentions are inserted as `@[path]`, `@[action:name]`, `@[command:name]`, or `@[obsidian-command:id]`, while hand-typed `@keyword` still resolves by fuzzy match.
- Lightweight local versioning under `.cancip/versions/`: manual commits and one daily auto snapshot, without native git and without per-edit history.
- Built-in local automation templates for non-desktop agent tasks: review-gate package generation, local capability-pack import, lightweight local version snapshots, GitHub status checks, vault index refresh, and a daily read-only Vault maintenance/merge-candidate report.
- TTS is provider-routed by language. English defaults to Web Speech / system TTS and does not need a local model package. Chinese can auto-download and use the current compact PrimeTTS Chinese/English ONNX package. Other languages use system/Web/custom URL unless a compatible local PrimeTTS package is installed under `tts/<package>/` with a manifest.

## Build

```bash
npm install
npm run check
npm run build
```

Build output is written to:

```text
outputs/cancip/
```

## Smoke Tests

Reusable Cancip regression cases live in:

```text
tests/cancip-regression-cases.json
```

The default smoke test is read-only and does not call the model API. It checks prompt economy, memory routing, Skill discovery, command bus access, automation templates, current Obsidian view, and attachment/external-file help:

```bash
npm run smoke
```

Run the normal development gate before committing:

```bash
npm run verify
```

Run the broader read-only command set. This still excludes the heavy UI button customization/sorting cases so the full command/memory gate does not inherit mobile-menu timeout noise:

```bash
npm run smoke:full
```

Run the heavier UI button customization/sorting checks separately. These tests exercise native menu snapshots and mobile-style sortable overlays, so they are intentionally outside both the default core smoke path and the broader command/memory smoke path. The UI profile fails fast on transport timeouts because one stale Obsidian eval can cascade into several false failures:

```bash
npm run smoke:ui
```

Every smoke run writes a timestamped report plus `reports/cancip-smoke-latest.json`. The latest report contains failed case ids, group counts, and next-action recommendations so another agent or Cancip itself can resume from the smallest failing surface.

Optional write/config tests create temporary files under `.cancip/test-lab` and then clean them up. Run them only when Vault write tests are intentionally allowed:

```bash
npm run smoke:write
```

If Obsidian CLI connectivity is stale after a crashed UI smoke, restart Obsidian and rerun the focused case. The smoke script now fails fast and writes a report instead of hanging when both eval transports fail:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/run-cancip-smoke.ps1 -Case memory -FailFast
```

Useful direct PowerShell filters:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/run-cancip-smoke.ps1 -Case memory
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/run-cancip-smoke.ps1 -Full -Case command
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/run-cancip-smoke.ps1 -Full -Case ui-button
```

## Install

Copy these files into an Obsidian community plugin folder named `cancip`:

```text
manifest.json
main.js
styles.css
versions.json
README.md
extras/code-1.jpg
extras/code-2.png
```

Then enable `Cancip` in Obsidian.

## TTS packages

Cancip supports multiple TTS routes:

- `auto`: picks a route by language and availability.
- `web-speech`: browser/WebView speech synthesis, useful for English when Android WebView exposes voices.
- `android-system`: native/system bridge route, used only when the Obsidian mobile environment exposes one.
- `builtin-prime-tts`: optional local ONNX package route.
- `custom-url`: trusted local/private TTS bridge route.

English is intentionally lightweight by default: `auto` tries Web Speech, Android/system, and custom URL before the local package. A local package is not required for ordinary English reading.

Chinese uses the current default downloadable local package when available:

```text
tts/prime-tts/acoustic_encoder.onnx
tts/prime-tts/acoustic_decoder.onnx
tts/prime-tts/vocoder.onnx
tts/prime-tts/meta.json
tts/prime-tts/symbol_table.json
tts/prime-tts/ort/ort-wasm-simd-threaded.mjs
tts/prime-tts/ort/ort-wasm-simd-threaded.wasm
```

The official review-clean plugin release ships only the core plugin files. Model/WASM assets are not bundled in the core release. Cancip downloads the default package only when the local install command/button is used, or when `builtin-prime-tts` is selected and the package is missing.

The default downloadable package is:

```text
https://github.com/arias007/cancip/releases/download/prime-tts/prime-tts.zip
```

The zip may contain the files at the archive root or inside one top-level folder such as `prime-tts/` or `prime-tts-zh-en/`.

Compatible packages for other languages can be installed as:

```text
tts/<package-id>/acoustic_encoder.onnx
tts/<package-id>/acoustic_decoder.onnx
tts/<package-id>/vocoder.onnx
tts/<package-id>/meta.json
tts/<package-id>/symbol_table.json
tts/<package-id>/ort/ort-wasm-simd-threaded.mjs
tts/<package-id>/ort/ort-wasm-simd-threaded.wasm
tts/<package-id>/manifest.json
```

Manifest example:

```json
{
  "engine": "prime-tts",
  "id": "prime-tts-ja",
  "label": "PrimeTTS Japanese package",
  "languages": ["ja-JP", "ja"],
  "notes": "Compatible ONNX PrimeTTS package."
}
```

When Cancip language is Japanese, Russian, Turkish, Uyghur, Korean, Spanish, French, German, Arabic, or another supported UI language, `auto` first checks whether an installed compatible local package declares that language. If not, Cancip falls back to system/Web/custom URL instead of pretending the bundled Chinese package can speak that language.

Use `cancip.tts.probe` to inspect the current route, selected package, installed compatible packages, and fallback reason. If the folder is missing or incomplete, Cancip reports that directly.

## Config

Cancip reads and writes:

```text
.cancip/config.json
```

On startup, `.cancip/config.json` wins over plugin `data.json` and the settings UI. Settings changed in the UI are saved back to both places.

API settings are stored in `apiProfiles`; the active profile is mirrored to the legacy `apiUrl`, `apiKey`, `apiMode`, and `model` fields for compatibility.

Do not commit or share `.cancip/config.json` if it contains an API key.

## Session Export

Use the history icon in the chat header to reload recent conversations. Cancip saves lightweight JSON session history under:

```text
.cancip/sessions/
```

Use the download icon to export the current conversation as a handoff/archive snapshot.

Cancip writes two files under:

```text
AI/Cancip/Exports/
```

The Markdown export is for reading and handoff to another agent. The JSON export preserves structured data:

- message ids, roles, timestamps, and full message text
- per-turn system prompt and context text actually sent to the model
- source hits attached to user messages
- current mode and access mode
- active API profile name/mode/model
- draft context currently attached to the composer
- key configuration booleans such as whether an API URL/key or GitHub token is configured
- tool run status, action summaries, results, and errors

The export intentionally does not include plaintext API keys or GitHub tokens.

## Command Bus

Cancip treats command execution like a CLI surface inside the vault, but the executable layer is structured and auditable instead of raw string eval.

Example:

````text
```cancip-action
{"actions":[{"type":"command","command":"obsidian.listCommands","args":{"query":"file","limit":20}}]}
```
````

Plan todo example:

````text
```cancip-action
{"actions":[{"type":"todo","op":"set","items":[{"text":"Inspect relevant files"},{"text":"Apply the patch"},{"text":"Run verification"}]}]}
```
````

Currently supported command names:

- `obsidian.listCommands`: list Obsidian internal command ids from `app.commands.commands`.
- `obsidian.resolveCommand`: resolve a fuzzy command name, translated label, or id into exact Obsidian command candidates.
- `obsidian.execute`: execute an Obsidian command by exact id or high-confidence fuzzy name, for example `{"id":"app:open-settings"}` or `{"query":"open command palette"}`.
- `obsidian.js.help`, `obsidian.js.probe`: inspect the Obsidian JS bridge before writing glue code. The probe reports active file/view, loaded plugin ids, command count, and helper methods.
- `obsidian.eval`: execute explicit Obsidian app/workspace/vault/plugin JavaScript in the current WebView. Aliases `obsidian.js`, `js.eval`, `javascript.eval`, and `browser.eval` route here. Use `args.code`, `args.script`, `args.js`, `args.body`, or `args.expression`. Available variables include `app`, `workspace`, `vault`, `metadataCache`, `activeDocument`, `window`, `args`, `plugins`, `activeFile`, `activeLeaf`, `activeView`, and `helpers.plugin/api/runCommand/openPath/notice/query/click/input/sleep/snapshot`.
- `cancip.pluginCapabilities`: inspect installed plugin capability routes by plugin name or feature words, including commands, runtime API surface, plugin files/settings, UI/API/config/web route hints, e.g. `{"query":"notedraw 涂鸦 高亮"}`.
- `cancip.pluginRoute`: generic plugin auto-adapter discovery for current or newly installed plugins. It summarizes commands, public API methods, settings/files, UI routes, and exact `pluginAction` examples.
- `cancip.pluginAction`: execute a plugin command or public API method after discovery, e.g. `{"pluginId":"plugin-id","commandQuery":"open panel"}` or `{"pluginId":"plugin-id","target":"api","method":"methodName","params":[]}`. Access mode controls approval/full-access execution.
- `cancip.annotate.help`, `cancip.annotate.note`, `cancip.annotate.pdf`: programmatic note/PDF annotation routes for NoteDraw/Pdftion-style highlighting, drawing, text, covers, exports, and active selection operations.
- `cancip.study.help`, `cancip.study.review`: spaced-repetition routes for review queue, active-note flashcards, all due cards, cram review, and note-review ratings.
- `cancip.rebuildIndex`: refresh Cancip's lightweight vault index.
- `cancip.reviewGate`: programmatically build native Cancip audit-panel data. Example args: `{"paths":["Folder/Note.md"],"maxFiles":20}` or `{"items":[{"path":"Note.md","old_text":"...","new_text":"..."}]}`.
- `cancip.reviewGate.list`: list recent review data packages under `AI/Cancip/Review/`.
- `cancip.previewVaultSearch`: preview local Vault Search results.
- `cancip.localVersionCommit`: create a manual lightweight local version commit.
- `cancip.vaultDailyReport`: generate a read-only Vault maintenance and merge-candidate daily report.
- `cancip.automation.templates`: list built-in local automation presets.
- `cancip.automation.addTemplate`: add a built-in preset, e.g. `{"id":"auto-review-gate-current-vault"}`.
- `cancip.automation.addVaultDailyReport`: add or refresh the daily Vault maintenance report automation.
- `todo` action type: maintain the current session's visible Plan todos. Supported operations are `set`, `add`, `update`, `remove`, `list`, and `clear`.
- `github.help`: list mobile GitHub command targets.
- `github.repo`: show repository status from GitHub REST.
- `github.issues`: list issues, e.g. `{"state":"open","limit":10}`.
- `github.pulls`: list pull requests.
- `github.releases`: list releases.
- `github.workflowRuns`: list GitHub Actions runs.
- `github.branches`: list branches.
- `github.file`: read a repository file or directory via Contents API, e.g. `{"path":"README.md"}`.
- `github.createIssue`: create an issue with `{"title":"...","body":"..."}`; requires a GitHub token.

JS boundary: this is an Obsidian WebView/API bridge, not an OS shell. `obsidian.js.help/probe` are read-only. `obsidian.eval` and aliases are effect-capable and follow Cancip access mode: confirmation mode queues Approve/Reject, while full-access executes directly.

GitHub settings live in the advanced Command bus group and mirror to `.cancip/config.json`:

```json
{
  "githubApiBaseUrl": "https://api.github.com",
  "githubOwner": "arias007",
  "githubRepo": "cancip",
  "githubToken": "",
  "autoContinueAfterTools": true,
  "maxToolIterations": 3
}
```

Use the official API or a trusted self-owned relay; do not send GitHub tokens through public accelerators.

`autoContinueAfterTools` controls whether completed tool runs are sent back to the model for another reasoning step. `maxToolIterations` caps the loop so a bad prompt cannot run forever.

## Roadmap

- Product target: mobile-first AI agent for an Obsidian vault, not a whole-device
  remote-control assistant.
- Keep the core boundary vault-scoped: Cancip can control vault files, `.cancip`
  config, configured project workspaces, GitHub, and plugin build/install
  workflows, but should not control the entire device.
- Absorb Smart Composer's Obsidian-native chat UX: file chips, current-file context, vault chat, tool visibility, and compact mobile controls.
- Keep a clear frontend interaction model: command bar, access-mode selector, project/session list, plan feature, and action transparency.
- Build the backend toward a local-first agent runtime with code actions, OpenClaw-style tool routing, and Hermes-style memory/workflow patterns.
- Support GitHub management from mobile: status, issues, branches, commits,
  pushes, PRs, releases, workflow results, and a safe API acceleration layer
  with credential redaction.
- Expand the command bus into the main backend interface: Obsidian commands,
  Cancip tools, plugin/skill tools, GitHub CLI-equivalent commands, and the
  Obsidian JS bridge should all connect to the AI through named, reviewable
  command actions.
- Continue expanding lightweight local versioning: restore/diff UI, retention,
  and GitHub sync from `.cancip/versions/`.
- Support Obsidian plugin building/adaptation: source-first TypeScript/CSS
  changes, build/package/install loops, and built-JS patching only as a
  fallback.
